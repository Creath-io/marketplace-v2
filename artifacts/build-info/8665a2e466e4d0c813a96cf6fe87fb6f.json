@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:\n ```\n contract ERC1967 {\n     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;\n     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {\n         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;\n     }\n     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {\n         require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), \"ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract\");\n         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;\n     }\n }\n ```\n _Available since v4.1 for `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, and `uint256`._"},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":1798,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1798],"name":"StorageSlotUpgradeable","nameLocation":"1287:22:14","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.AddressSlot","id":1744,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1743,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1353:5:14","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1744,"src":"1345:13:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":1742,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1345:7:14","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"AddressSlot","nameLocation":"1323:11:14","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1798,"src":"1316:49:14","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.BooleanSlot","id":1747,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1746,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1405:5:14","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1747,"src":"1400:10:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"},"typeName":{"id":1745,"name":"bool","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1400:4:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"BooleanSlot","nameLocation":"1378:11:14","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1798,"src":"1371:46:14","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.Bytes32Slot","id":1750,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1749,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1460:5:14","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1750,"src":"1452:13:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":1748,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1452:7:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"Bytes32Slot","nameLocation":"1430:11:14","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1798,"src":"1423:49:14","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.Uint256Slot","id":1753,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1752,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1515:5:14","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1753,"src":"1507:13:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"typeName":{"id":1751,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1507:7:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"Uint256Slot","nameLocation":"1485:11:14","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1798,"src":"1478:49:14","visibility":"public"},{"body":{"id":1763,"nodeType":"Block","src":"1709:106:14","statements":[{"AST":{"nodeType":"YulBlock","src":"1771:38:14","statements":[{"nodeType":"YulAssignment","src":"1785:14:14","value":{"name":"slot","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1795:4:14"},"variableNames":[{"name":"r.slot","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1785:6:14"}]}]},"documentation":"@solidity

be created\n  - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed\n ====\n [IMPORTANT]\n ====\n You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!\n Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets\n like Gnosis Safe, and does not provide security since it can be circumvented by calling from a contract\n constructor.\n

constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ``` contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section].\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol\":\"IERC20PermitUpgradeable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcc70d8e2281fb3ff69e8ab242500f10142cd0a7fa8dd9e45882be270d4d09024\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://17a4063bc918df0f7bb9cbf04c6f0bb4977afab3f2fc212bc138a178312a221d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZMdvsHP5mDEAAdrK4bNeNh47TfmSFgN9qEBFTbie7zmm\"]}},\"version\":1}","storageLayout":{"storage":[],"types":null}}},"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol":{"SafeERC20Upgradeable":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60566050600b82828239805160001a6073146043577f4e487b7100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000600052600060045260246000fd5b30600052607381538281f3fe73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea264697066735822122063e82f964ec44923f15b285a9448cc35b6e9184c93fd09b551c1dbf49ae5e9ca64736f6c63430008040033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x56 PUSH1 0x50 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH1 0x0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x43 JUMPI PUSH32 0x4E487B7100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH1 0x0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 PUSH4 0xE82F964E 0xC4 0x49 0x23 CALL JUMPDEST 0x28 GAS SWAP5 0x48 0xCC CALLDATALOAD 0xB6 0xE9 XOR 0x4C SWAP4 REVERT MULMOD 0xB5 MLOAD 0xC1 0xDB DELEGATECALL SWAP11 0xE5 0xE9 0xCA PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD DIV STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"740:3847:10:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea264697066735822122063e82f964ec44923f15b285a9448cc35b6e9184c93fd09b551c1dbf49ae5e9ca64736f6c63430008040033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 PUSH4 0xE82F964E 0xC4 0x49 0x23 CALL JUMPDEST 0x28 GAS SWAP5 0x48 0xCC CALLDATALOAD 0xB6 0xE9 XOR 0x4C SWAP4 REVERT MULMOD 0xB5 MLOAD 0xC1 0xDB DELEGATECALL SWAP11 0xE5 0xE9 0xCA PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD DIV STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"740:3847:10:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false).
